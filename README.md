# About
This is a minimal Audioplayer with a Playlist feature. It is especially Designed for Audiobooks.

## Styling

Everything is Styled with styled Components, you can change anything to your liking. 
The standard Colors and font-sizes can be adjusted in the GlobalStyles.js file

## Adding Audio-Tracks

in utils you will find chapters.js. This is the object that contains all the Information for the Audio-Player. 
You can either use the assets Folder to organise your Images and Audios as I did and import them into the chapters.js file
or use the public folder. 

The Copyright for the Sample Pictures and Tracks belongs to Nikolai Winter. They are not to be reposted! 
If you are Interested in checking out the whole Audiobook, you can buy the Book "SPOOKY" by Nikolai Winter(it comes with the book)

## Things to improve

Right now, the duration of the tracks displayed in the Playlist is hard coded and not calculated. This could be something to improve.
